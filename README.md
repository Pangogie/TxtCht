TxtCht
======

A small, sloppy chat program I've put together.

Basically I found a tutorial a long time ago that described how to put together a chat program that uses UDP.
It worked quite well with UDP except for the very occasional packet loss.

So I decided to switch fully to TCP. That's when the issues started.

I really want to expand this program to be better and more interesting, but I first need to make it work again.

Help

So ya, basically I would love some help.  
If you have any sort of ideas shoot them at me.  
If you have a bug fix go ahead and send a requesting thing.
