TxtCht
======
A small, sloppy chat program I've put together. Basically I found a tutorial a long time ago that described how to put together a chat program that uses UDP in C#. It worked quite well with UDP except for the very occasional packet loss. 
So I decided to switch fully to TCP. That's when the issues started. I really want to expand this program to be better and more interesting, but I first need to make it work again.
The name is a joke when the program used to drop UDP packets.

Help

So ya, basically I would love some help. If you have any sort of ideas shoot them at me. If you have a bug fix go ahead and send a requesting thing.
